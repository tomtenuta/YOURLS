# Behaviors
- At new feature entry, provide a **1-paragraph plan** with risks before coding.
- After significant change, output a **"What changed & why"** summary.
- When adding config, update **/docs/config.md** and note default values + rationale.
- If ambiguity is detected, propose **two options with tradeoffs** and pick one with justification.
