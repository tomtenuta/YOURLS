# Levels
- **Unit:** pure functions, validators, mappers.
- **Integration:** DB, cache, queue interactions.
- **Contract:** API schemas & compatibility (YOURLS/TinyURL shims).
- **Load tests:** resolve RPS, cache hit ratio, p95/p99 latency.

# Requirements
- Deterministic tests; seeded fixtures; hermetic CI.
- Golden files for response shapes; strict JSON schema checks.
