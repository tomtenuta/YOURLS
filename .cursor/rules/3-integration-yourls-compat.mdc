# Scope
- Provide endpoints or adapters for common YOURLS functions to ease client migration.
- Map YOURLS-style create/expand calls to our internal API without leaking internals.

# Semantics
- Maintain 301 redirect behavior.
- Respect slug collisions and reserved keywords similarly, with config escape hatches.

# Limits
- We do NOT re-implement full YOURLS plugin ecosystem; only the surface required for your clients.
