# Targets
- PHP 8.2+; strict types; PSR-12 style; Composer autoloading.
- Framework optional; if chosen, minimal dependencies only.

# Conventions
- Separate controllers/handlers from services and repositories.
- DTOs for request/response; explicit types; no mixed arrays.
- Database access via parameterized queries or ORM with prepared statements.

# Performance
- Cache first for resolve path; Redis TTL tuning; cache stampede protection (singleflight).
