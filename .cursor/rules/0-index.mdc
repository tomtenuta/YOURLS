title: Project Index — URL Shortener (Global)
description: Global, always-on rules for this YOURLS-style shortener.

# Purpose
These global rules define how the AI should interpret requirements, ask for missing info inline, and keep the project consistent.

## Behaviors
1) **Prefer configuration over convention drift.** If unsure, create a config entry and document it in README and /docs.
2) **Be explicit:** Name things by domain meaning (ShortLink, ClickEvent, ApiKey).
3) **Write minimal code to satisfy the test + spec;** avoid speculative features.
4) **Surface assumptions** as TODOs in code comments and in PR descriptions.
5) **Adhere to file-local rules:** If a specialized `.mdc` applies, it overrides these general tips.

## Output Expectations (for all code the AI writes)
- Small, composable modules; single responsibility.
- Clear input/output contracts; documented types.
- Observability hooks (metrics/logs) at integration seams.
- Secure-by-default (no secrets in code, no unsafe defaults).

## When to Ask (inline)
- Unknown domain config (custom domain, SSL termination, rate limits, storage quotas).
- Unclear TinyURL compatibility requirements.
- Ambiguous analytics granularity or retention periods.

## Non-Goals
- Do not implement third-party tracking or PII collection beyond what is described in privacy rule.
- Do not include demo credentials or placeholder secrets.
